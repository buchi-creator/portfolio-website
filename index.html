            <p class="about" id="section-about">
                I‚Äôm Miracle, a passionate software engineer from Enugu State, Nigeria. I specialize in building reliable, scalable, and user-centered software solutions that solve real-world problems. Growing up in Enugu, I was always fascinated by how technology could simplify life, and that curiosity led me into the world of software development.

                Over the years, I‚Äôve honed my skills in languages like JavaScript, Python, and Java, and I work comfortably with frameworks such as React, Node.js, and Django. I enjoy both frontend and backend development, and I‚Äôm constantly learning and experimenting with new tools, whether it‚Äôs exploring cloud platforms or diving into AI and automation.

                For me, software engineering is not just about writing code, it‚Äôs about understanding problems and designing thoughtful solutions. I take pride in writing clean, maintainable code and working in collaborative environments where communication and teamwork are key. I‚Äôm especially drawn to projects that create real impact, whether it's for local businesses, community tools, or global platforms.

                Beyond coding, I‚Äôm passionate about sharing knowledge. I enjoy mentoring aspiring developers, contributing to open-source projects, and participating in local tech communities. I believe that as we grow individually, we should also lift others along the way.

                When I‚Äôm not coding, I like exploring new ideas, reading about emerging technologies, or just unwinding with good music and a bit of local cuisine. I strive for a balanced life that keeps me grounded, creative, and inspired.

                Looking ahead, I‚Äôm excited to keep growing, building, and contributing, not just as a developer, but as someone shaping meaningful change through technology.
